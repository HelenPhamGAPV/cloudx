          Generative AI, distinct from traditional AI models, introduces a broad
          spectrum of opportunities for businesses integrating it into their
          operations. These models leverage creativity and “reasoning”, making
          them versatile for numerous applications. For example, Generative AI
          is useful to <span class="font-bold">process extensive datasets</span>
          —such as contracts, databases, and financial reports—
          <span class="font-bold">to extract insights or automate tasks</span>,
          saving significant human labor. Additionally, the integration of Large
          Language Models with vision capabilities can enhance manual business
          processes, such as interpreting and digitizing data from paper
          documents. These are only a few use cases where Generative AI can be
          helpful in the enterprise world.

              should make good UX/UI Design a priority to remain competitive and
